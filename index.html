    <h3>Utilizing The Portability Of Docker To Design A Portable And Scalable Continuous Integration Stack</h3>
    <div>
        <b>Submitted to:</b> Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium (MICS)

        <b>Abstract:</b>
        <p>
With the release of Docker as an open source project in March of
2013, the project has gained substantial pull in the world of systems
administration, and especially in software development. The removal
of the hypervisor layer, as well as the reduction of unnecessary
dependencies in Docker based virtual machines - commonly called
images - allows for extremely reduced storage footprints and
effectively (as explained on the project's website) allows "'dockerized'
projects to be completely portable"("What is Docker?"). This
portability makes for a powerful tool when designing continuous
integration stacks.

    <h3>Using Neural Networks To Detect Examples of Ad Hominem In Politics And Miroblogging Platforms</h3>

        <p>
With the presently ongoing race for the United States presidency, analysis of the currently
participating candidates is under heavy analysis by politicians and civilians alike. A well
noted factor of many of the candidate's oratory during debates are examples of the logical
fallacy ad hominem. Ad hominem is a logical fallacy where instead of responding to
another's argument, the person seeks to undermine the argument by attacking the personal
character of the argument giver. Recently, candidates have begun to make use of
microblogging services as a way to publicize their opinions and as such candidates often
commit ad hominem against one another. The social nature of microblogging services
commonly allows private users to comment upon candidate posts creating additional
opportunities for ad hominem to be used.

    <h3>Applying Convolutional Neural Networks to Per-pixel Orthoimagery Land Use Classification</h3>

        <b>Abstract:</b>
        <p>
Recently, the proliferation of Convolutional Neural Networks has spurred research in a
wide range of fields such as image recognition, voice synthesis, and various other classification
tasks. Over the last several years, the availability of satellite and other forms
of orthoimagery has also increased due to the decreasing cost of capturing devices. The
amount of annotated or labeled orthoimagery has not kept pace with the increased availability
of imagery, largely due to the time complexity of labeling such data. Land cover
usage classifications in particular would have many uses in agriculture. The United States
Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service provides land cover
usage data at a resolution of 30 meters, which compared with - for example - a 1 meter
imagery resolution, leaves a large discrepancy between the quality of the raw image data
and the labeling data. This research uses these low quality labels along with high quality
image data to train a model that attempts to perform per-pixel land use classification, in
hopes to create a classifier that is able to predict several different classes of land use, up to
or beyond the resolution accuracy of the much less adequate label data set. It is important
to note however, that it is very difficult to evaluate if a model provides relatively better
classifications based on the semantics of the input image, due to the low resolution of the
image labels. This is because, an individual pixel in the image label will only represent one
class per NxN meter area - in the case of our data set, a 30x30 meter area. That individual
pixel may be a poor representation of features actually represented in the higher resolution
image data. Thusly, we will attempt to demonstrate that, with enough data, a model may
generate higher a resolution classification than the original imagery labels with a reasonable
margin of error, and attempt to define a way to evaluate the effectiveness of the model
despite the poor resolution of the image labels.

    <h3>Exploring the Usefulness of Adding Auxiliary Preprocessed Image Layers With Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
    <div>
        <b>Submitted to:</b> Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium (MICS)
        <br>
        <b>Published:</b> April 2018
        <br>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        <p>
Convolutional Neural Networks have fast become the pinnacle of a wide variety of image
processing tasks. From image labeling to image segmentation, convolutional neural networks
continue to outperform many other image processing techniques. In some domains
such as scene labeling additional image layers such as depth, or Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) help to increase the quality of the classification, especially in
the realm of image segmentation. Typically, these additional data layers come from other
sensor equipment, and are not directly derived from the base image. For example, NDVI
requires Near Infra-Red(NIR) data which must be captured with specialized equipment.
Due to the abstractness of the patterns Convolutonal Neural Networks learn to detect, it
is difficult to determine if additional data layers created by preprocessing the source images
will aid in the classification task. The goal of this study is comparing the accuracy
and quantitative quality of land use classifications with and without the addition of several
different auxiliary preprocessed image layers. We will examine the output of a SegNet
CNN with the inclusion of several different kinds of auxiliary data layers generated from
the original images layers. There is the possibility that the Convolutional Neural Network
is able to pick up on the patterns that the various preprocessing methods highlight, however,
there is no clear way to tell at face value. By testing the model with and without the
auxiliary image layers, we will attempt to discern whether the CNN benefits from these
additional layers - meaning that the CNN on its own may not detect the types of patterns
that the preprocessing methods do. Another possible outcome may be that the additional
data throws off the CNN (if the CNN performs worse with the extra layers than without), or
that the CNN does not perform significantly better or worse - suggesting that the additional
data layers do not add anything that the CNN isn’t picking up on.
